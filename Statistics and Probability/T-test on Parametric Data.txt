T-TESTS:
EXAMINE IF THE DIFFERENCE IN MEANS IS SIGNIFICANT OR NOT

### ONE SIDED T-TEST
### test if the mean value is equal to a certian number
### H0: true value of mean=18
t.test(ToothGrowth$len,mu=18)
 
#or greater than or less than a given value

t.test(ToothGrowth$len, alternative = "greater", mu = 3)
#H0: true value of mean is 3


# INDEPENDENT 2-GROUP T-TEST
# test the difference in mean
#H0: These is no difference in the population means of the 2 groups
# split data set

t.test(OJ, VC,
       paired = FALSE, var.equal = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95) 
#Variances of tooth growth are different when using different supplement and dosage.

#TEST FOR MEAN BEING SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT

t.test(OJ, VC,alternative = "greater",paired = FALSE) 

#TEST FOR MEAN BEING SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER
#paired=FALSE : measurements collected seperately
#If you randomly sample each set of items separately, under different conditions, the samples are independent


## paired observations: If you collect two measurements on each item
t.test(OJ, VC,
       paired = TRUE, var.equal = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95) 

#e.g before or after treatments
# OJ and VC were applied on test subjects in 2 treatment groups
